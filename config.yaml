# Configuration file for FlightGazer

CONFIG_VERSION: v.2.4.0 # do not modify this

# ================ General settings ================
# ==================================================

FLYBY_STATS_ENABLED: false
# Save general stats of planes and API usage to a CSV file in the directory this is stored in.
# Note that if FlightGazer is restarted at some point in the day and this setting is false,
# FlightGazer will not be able to recall the amount of planes tracked so far for that day before it was restarted.

UNITS: 0
# Select which units to use. 
# 0 = aeronautical (nmi, ft, kt)
# 1 = metric (km, m, km/h)
# 2 = imperial (mi, ft, mph)

HEIGHT_LIMIT: 15000
# Filter out planes at an altitude higher than this (feet or meters)

RANGE: 2
# Radius of which planes need to be in for detailed tracking (nautical miles, kilometers, or miles)

FLYBY_STALENESS: 60
# If the same plane appears again before this time, do not consider it as a flyby (in minutes, as an integer)

LOCATION_TIMEOUT: 60
# How much time must pass before a plane's last location is considered stale and removed from tracking (in seconds).
# Valid range: (15..60) as an integer. If less than 60, affects total plane count.
# This setting, if low enough, will cause planes that are present in the area to "drop out" more readily
# if they don't report a timely location update.

API_KEY: ''
# Put your FlightAware API key here. Leave as '' to not use the API.

API_DAILY_LIMIT: 
# Set this to an integer value if you want to limit calls.
# If you want to have unlimited API calls, set this to null or an empty value.

CUSTOM_DUMP1090_LOCATION: ''
# URL of your dump1090 install if it is in a different location or on a different network device.
# ex: `http://localhost/custom_name_here` or `http://192.168.xxx.xxx:8080` (no trailing `/`)

CUSTOM_DUMP978_LOCATION: ''
# URL of your dump978 install if it is in a different location or on a different network device.
# If you're not using dump978, leave the value as ''.
# ex: `http://192.168.xxx.xxx:8978`

# ============= Screen Output settings =============
# ==================================================

ENHANCED_READOUT: false
# If true, show more details on plane info screen and replaces origin and destination readout.
# Will not use API even if a key is provided. Useful if API is not in use.
# Additional details include plane coordinates, ground track, vertical rate, and RSSI

DISPLAY_SUNRISE_SUNSET: false
# If true, show sunrise and sunset times on the Clock screen

DISPLAY_RECEIVER_STATS: false
# If true, show receiver stats (gain, noise, % loud signals) on the Clock screen.
# Overwrites sunrise/sunset display if `DISPLAY_SUNRISE_SUNSET` is enabled.

CLOCK_24HR: false
# If true, use 24 hour clock. If false, 12 hour clock will be used

# ============== Brightness settings ===============
# ==================================================

BRIGHTNESS: 100
# Set the LED brightness (0..100)

ENABLE_TWO_BRIGHTNESS: true
# If true, enables dynamically switching brightness. If false, only `BRIGHTNESS` will be used.

BRIGHTNESS_2: 50
# Secondary LED brightness (0..100).
# `BRIGHTNESS_2` will be used from sunset to sunrise ("night") and `BRIGHTNESS` will be used for all other times.

BRIGHTNESS_SWITCH_TIME:
  Sunrise: 06:00
  Sunset: 18:00
# Set the time of day (in 24-hr format) to switch brightness levels.

USE_SUNRISE_SUNSET: true
# If true, use sunrise and sunset times to adjust brightness.
# If sunrise or sunset times are not available, will fall back to `BRIGHTNESS_SWITCH_TIME` values.

ACTIVE_PLANE_DISPLAY_BRIGHTNESS:
# When there is an active plane, use a different brightness level (0..100). Useful for grabbing attention.
# Overrides all other brightness settings when a plane is being tracked. This value does not depend if
# `ENABLE_TWO_BRIGHTNESS` is enabled.
# If you do not want the brightness to change, set this to null or an empty value.

# ============== RGB-Matrix settings ===============
# ==================================================

GPIO_SLOWDOWN: 2
# Set this to the specific value that works for your setup. 
# Higher values are more suited for faster/more modern Raspberry Pi's

HAT_PWM_ENABLED: true
# If you set the quality modification for the RGB-Matrix hat, set to true. If not, set to false.

RGB_ROWS: 32
# Number of LED rows in your display

RGB_COLS: 64
# Number of LED columns in your display

LED_PWM_BITS: 8
# Lower decreases color depth but increases refresh rate. Adjust to taste
