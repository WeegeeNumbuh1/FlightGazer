## üö© About
This is a personal project that was heavily inspired by [Colin Waddell's project](https://github.com/ColinWaddell/its-a-plane-python), but supplements flight information of
nearby aircraft with real-time ADS-B ([Automatic Dependendent Surveillance - Broadcast](https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/205/what-is-ads-b-and-who-needs-it/213#213)) and UAT (Universial Access Transceiver) data from [dump1090](https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090) and dump978.<br>
Uses the [tar1090 database](https://github.com/wiedehopf/tar1090-db) for aircraft type and owner along with an internal database for airline lookup by callsign.<br>
Uses the FlightAware API to get an aircraft's departure and destination airports.

Designed primarily to run on a Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi OS, but can be run on other setups (your mileage may vary).

As usual, this project was developed before being tracked by `git`. ![:gladsuna:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/824790344431435817.webp?size=24)<br>
>[!NOTE]
> Fun fact: this is also the author's second-only Python project.

## üí™ Features
***The [Changelog](Changelog.txt) has all the details, but as a bulleted list:***
<details><summary><b>Show/Hide</b></summary>

### Summary
- Visualize and figure out what aircraft are flying nearby your location, in a cool-looking way!
  - Shows an aircraft's callsign (or registration as fallback), distance and direction from your location, the aircraft's country of registration, current altitude, and speed, all provided from `dump1090`
  - With API access you also can see the origin and destination airport, as well as how long the aircraft has been flying
  - If you don't want to use the API, there's an available "Enhanced Readout" mode that shows even more aircraft info from `dump1090`, such as latitude, longitude, ground track, vertical speed, and RSSI
  - With v.6.0.0 and newer, you can see additional info like aircraft type, airline, and owner, all without needing API access
  - There are a total of [3 different layouts for aircraft info](#screen-layout)!
- It's a neat looking clock when there aren't any aircraft flying overhead
  - When `dump1090` is running, shows overall stats like how many aircraft you're tracking at the moment, how many aircraft flew by today, and the furthest aircraft you can detect
  - Display sunrise and sunset times, detailed signal stats for your ADS-B receiver, and/or extended calendar info

### Adaptive & flexible
- Automatically switches to other aircraft if more than one is within the area
- Can emulate an RGB Matrix display in a browser if you don't have the actual hardware
- Does not need to run on the same hardware that `dump1090` is running from
- Reads `dump978` data if it's present as well
- Customizable features such as:
  - Range of which aircraft need to be in for detailed tracking
  - Height filtering
  - Units (aeronautical, metric, or imperial)
  - Clock style (12 hour or 24 hour)
  - Brightness based on time of day or when there's an active aircraft shown
  - API limiting per day, by monthly cost, or even by the hour (those API calls can get expensive)
  - Writing to a stats file that keeps count of number of aircraft flying by per day (and API usage as well)
  - Track a specific aircraft once it's detected by your ADS-B receiver
  - Colors üåà
  - Switch between font styles
  - and more
- Known to work with [PiAware](https://www.flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/build)/[FlightFeeder](https://www.flightaware.com/adsb/flightfeeder/), [ADSBExchange](https://www.adsbexchange.com/sd-card-docs/), [Ultrafeeder](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-adsb-ultrafeeder), and [ADSB.im](https://adsb.im/home) setups
  - Setups that were initially built around using AirNav Radar's `rbfeeder` or Flightradar24's [`Pi24`](https://www.flightradar24.com/build-your-own) need a single settings change (see [Tips](#tricks--tips))

### Other good stuff
- Highly optimized and fast
  - Worst case takes ~25ms on average from raw data to fully parsed, filtered, run through the selection algorithm, and formatted
    - The above statistic taken from a Rasberry Pi Zero 2W w/ 32-bit OS operating as a 99.9th percentile (worldwide) ADS-B+UAT receiver at peak traffic while sending data to multiple ADS-B aggregators with MLAT
- Useful and detailed console output that shows the inner workings of FlightGazer
- Small memory footprint once settled (10-40 MiB)
- Fully Python based
  - The python script has been verified to run in both Linux (Debian) and Windows. (MacOS untested)
- All installed components confirmed to run on `ARMv7`, `ARMv8`, `x86_64`, `i686`
- Runs from a initialization script that handles everything such as initial setup and running the python script (Linux only)
  - Set up to automatically start on boot via `systemd`
- Easily update to latest builds here on Github
  - Automagically migrate settings, even if new options appear or are removed in the future
- A web interface that makes it easier to configure, check, and update FlightGazer (as a separate project)
- Program state is available in a json file for use elsewhere
- Logs events when you detect aircraft beyond typical ADS-B range limits (DXing)
- Robust and hard-to-break
- Unique tools and fonts that can be used in other projects (don't forget to credit me)
- Constant development
- Adequate documentation

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites (Important)

<details><summary><b>Show/Hide</b></summary>

Using this project assumes you have the following:
#### MINIMUM
- A working `dump1090` instance or similar interface where `aircraft.json` can be read/accessed
  - Ex: [`tar1090`](https://github.com/wiedehopf/tar1090)/[`readsb`](https://github.com/wiedehopf/readsb), [`piaware`](https://www.flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/)/`skyaware`, `dump1090-fa`, `dump1090-mutability`
    - Note: the script will automatically look at these locations and choose which one works
  - This script does not need to be on the same device that `dump1090` is running from (see [Configuration](#Ô∏è-configuration) section)
  - Your ADS-B decoder must output in aeronautical units (nautical miles, knots, feet)
- The latest Python (>=3.9)
- At least 100 MB of available disk space
- A working internet connection for setup
- *for Linux distros:*
  - Basic knowledge of how to use `bash` or similar terminal
  - `ssh` access if running headless
  - `apt` as the package manager
  - Root access (necessary for accessing the RGBMatrix hardware)
  - `systemd` based system
#### Highly Recommmended
- The [rgbmatrix](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix) library installed and present on the system
  - Refer to [adafruit's guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rgb-matrix-bonnet-for-raspberry-pi/) on how to get this working if it's not installed already
  - If the `rgbmatrix` library is installed:
    - It needs to be accessible as a Python module globally or in the same home directory of the user that installed FlightGazer
    - Must be built using the adafruit script
  - `rgbmatrix` does not need to be installed to run FlightGazer, however. (see [Usage](#Ô∏è-usage) section)
- The physical RGB matrix hardware (again, not strictly necessary)
  - Recommended: Using the [adafruit matrix bonnet](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3211)
  - Using `64x32` sized, HUB75 type matrix display (this is the only layout this script was designed for)
  - Other matrix displays and setups can be used as well using advanced settings
- Your location set in `dump1090`
- A console that can interpret ANSI escape sequences (should be most modern ones)
- If using a Raspberry Pi, use a model that has multiple CPU cores (Raspberry Pi 3/Raspberry Pi 2W or newer)
- Not using a combined feed for the data source (you would know if you set this up)
#### For Enhanced Functionality
- A [FlightAware API key](https://www.flightaware.com/commercial/aeroapi/) (optional) for getting additional aircraft information such as origin/destination airports
- a running `dump978` instance if you're in the US and live near airports that handle general aviation more than commercial flights

</details>
<br>

**tl;dr** You need a running `dump1090` instance and if it's not running on the same device as FlightGazer you need to know a valid URL to access its data.<br>
You don't actually need a physical RGB display, but it's recommended. Other ADS-B decoders will not work. Your site location needs to be set for most of the functionality to work.<br>
*Note:* FlightGazer will not work with UAT-only setups and assumes single-site decoders (not a combined feed).

### üì∂ Installation & Getting Started
Make sure you meet the above prerequisites. To begin:
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/WeegeeNumbuh1/FlightGazer
cd FlightGazer
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once the above command is completed, it is recommended to **configure your setup now** before running the initialization file.<br>See the [Configuration](#Ô∏è-configuration) section below, then return to this step.

<details open><summary>if running Linux (Debian) / Raspberry Pi</summary>

then run the following:
```
sudo bash FlightGazer-init.sh
```
which will set up everything needed to run FlightGazer and then will start FlightGazer afterwards.<br>
**If you'd like to change the setup behavior before the first run, [check out the options](#-optional-behaviors).**
</details>
<details><summary>if running Windows</summary>

You will need to put in some elbow grease here.
>[!IMPORTANT]
> You're likely not going to be running `rgbmatrix` on Windows. Instead, use `RGBMatrixEmulator`.

```powershell
pip install psutil
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages "\path\to\new-python-venv"
cd "\path\to\new-python-venv\Scripts"
pip install requests
pip install pydispatcher
pip install schedule
pip install RGBMatrixEmulator
pip install suntime
pip install orjson
pip install ruamel.yaml
```
If you don't care for running in a virtual environment, skip the `python3 -m venv` and `cd "path\to..."` lines and install the packages globally.<br>
Then, [read here](#-misc).

</details>

### üéöÔ∏è Configuration

Edit [`config.yaml`](./config.yaml) which is found in the same directory as the main script itself.<br>
If you changed any setting, FlightGazer must be [restarted](#-shutting-down--restarting) for the change to take effect.<br>
Example:
```bash
cd /path/to/Flightgazer
nano config.yaml
# press Ctrl+O to save, Ctrl+X to exit
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the configuration file is missing or has invalid values, the main script has built-in fallbacks. It will alert you as necessary.<br>
> (Just don't try to purposely break the script!)

#### Adjusting Colors
Edit [`colors.py`](./setup/colors.py) in the `setup` folder of FlightGazer.

#### Tricks & Tips
<details><summary>Configuration details for a remote dump1090 installation (eg: FlightAware-provided FlightFeeder)</summary>

Set `CUSTOM_DUMP1090_LOCATION` to the IP address of the device running dump1090.<br>
Example: `http://192.168.xxx.xxx:8080` or `http://192.168.xxx.xxx/skyaware`<br>
And then set `PREFER_LOCAL` to `false`.

</details>
<details><summary>If you initially built your ADS-B receiver around RadarBox24/AirNav Radar's rbfeeder or Flightradar24's Pi24 image</summary>

`rbfeeder` and `Pi24` setups don't provide a web interface that FlightGazer can look at.<br>
FlightGazer can only run directly on those systems and must be installed on those devices (dump1090 data cannot be read remotely).<br>
Set `PREFER_LOCAL` to `true` so that FlightGazer can read the data from these setups.<br>

If you managed to install a working web interface like `tar1090` with these setups then you're an advanced user and you already know what you're doing.<br>

</details>

<details><summary>Connecting to a separate dump978 feeder (over the network)</summary>

Set `CUSTOM_DUMP978_LOCATION` to the IP address of the dump978 system.<br>
Example: `http://192.168.xxx.xxx:8978`<br>
If dump1090 is running on the same system FlightGazer is running off of, leave `PREFER_LOCAL` to `true`.<br>
FlightGazer was designed to handle reading from both a local dump1090 instance and a remote dump978 system at the same time.<br>
However, if your network goes down or the dump978 system disconnects, this will cause FlightGazer to pause its processing as if dump1090 failed as well.<br>
Also important to note, if your dump978 instance uses a different set location than your dump1090 one, the distance data for UAT aircraft will be overridden by your dump1090 location.

</details>

<details><summary>Turning off the screen at night</summary>

`ENABLE_TWO_BRIGHTNESS: true`<br>
`BRIGHTNESS_2: 0`

If you don't want it to turn off at sunset,<br>
`USE_SUNRISE_SETSET: false`<br>
then set `BRIGHTNESS_SWITCH_TIME` to whatever time you want.

Note that FlightGazer will still be running *and* driving the screen even with a brightness of `0` so CPU usage will remain the same.

</details>
<details><summary>Only turn on the screen when there's an aircraft nearby (no clock)</summary>

`BRIGHTNESS: 0`<br>
`ENABLE_TWO_BRIGHTNESS: false`<br>
`ACTIVE_PLANE_DISPLAY_BRIGHTNESS: <your value here>`

</details>

<details><summary>Hiding elements on the display</summary>

Go to the color config file and set whatever element you don't want to show to `BLACK`.<br>
Example: `seconds_color = BLACK`

</details>

<details><summary>Reduce flickering on a physical RGB matrix display</summary>

- [Do the PWM mod](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix?tab=readme-ov-file#improving-flicker)
- [Reserve a CPU core solely for the display](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix?tab=readme-ov-file#cpu-use)
- Lower the value for `LED_PWM_BITS` (though `8` seems good enough)
- Switch CPU governor to `performance` or add `force_turbo=1` to a Raspberry Pi's `config.txt` file
 
</details>

### üíª Making Things Easier (Recommended)

Want to make dealing with FlightGazer easier without having to use terminal commands all the time? (the author sure did)<br>
Install the web interface that manages basically everything to do with FlightGazer.<br>
The web interface can be installed using:<br>
```bash
sudo bash /path/to/FlightGazer/install-FlightGazer-webapp.sh
```
The web interface can be accessed via<br>
`http://<IP-address-of-device-running-FlightGazer>/flightgazer`<br>
or on port `9898/flightgazer` if there's no web server present on the device running FlightGazer.
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage
The main python script ([`FlightGazer.py`](./FlightGazer.py)) is designed to be started by the [`FlightGazer-init.sh`](./FlightGazer-init.sh) file.<br>
When FlightGazer is installed, you can use the command `sudo systemctl start flightgazer` to start it if it's not already running.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, the script is designed to run at boot (via systemd with `flightgazer.service`).<br>
> You can check its status with:
> ```bash
> sudo tmux attach -d -t FlightGazer # press 'Ctrl+B' then 'd' to close
> # or
> systemctl status flightgazer # press 'q' to exit
> # or
> less /path/to/FlightGazer/FlightGazer-log.log # read the log output, press 'q' to quit
> # or
> less /run/FlightGazer/current_state.json
> # or
> journalctl -u flightgazer # use arrow keys to navigate, press 'q' to exit
> ```
### ‚öôÔ∏è Interactive Mode
However, the script and python file are also designed to run interactively in a console. If you run the following command manually:
```
sudo bash /path/to/FlightGazer/FlightGazer-init.sh
```
The script automatically detects that you're running interactively and will display realtime output, like so:
<details open><summary>Example output</summary>

<img src="media/FG_ConsoleOutput.gif" alt="FlightGazer console gif">

*Note: In the above gif, FlightGazer is operating in verbose mode. When normally running, there's way less information overload.*

</details>

### üî° Optional Behaviors

`FlightGazer-init.sh` supports optional arguments that adjust the behaviors of the FlightGazer installation and main python script. Expand the table below to see all possible operating modes. Multiple flags can be passed as well.

<details><summary>Table of operating modes</summary>
<div align="center">

| Flag | Enables<br>interactive<br>mode in<br>FlightGazer? | What it does |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| (no flag) | ‚ùå | Default operating mode when not run as a service.<br>Minimizes console output when running non-interactively.<br>Will use `rgbmatrix`. Uses `RGBMatrixEmulator` as a fallback.
|`-d`| ‚úÖ | Do not load any display driver. Only print console output.<br>Overrides `-e`. |
|`-e`| ‚ùå | Use `RGBMatrixEmulator` as the display driver instead of actual hardware.<br>Display by default can be seen in an internet browser.<br>(see the Tip below)
|`-f`| ‚úÖ | No Filter mode.<br>Ignores set `RANGE` and `HEIGHT_LIMIT` settings and shows all aircraft detected.<br>Display will never show aircraft details and remain as a clock.<br>Useful for low traffic areas.|
|`-t`| ‚úÖ | Run in `tmux`. Useful for long-running interactive sessions. <br>Default operating mode when started as a service.
|`-c`| ‚ùå | Only install/force-check dependencies and don't start the main script.
|`-v`| ‚ùå | Enable verbose/debug messages to be displayed/logged from the main script.
|`-l`| ‚ùå | Live/Demo mode.<br>Does not install service and runs FlightGazer from dependencies in `/tmp`.
|`-h`| ‚ùå | Print the help message.

</details>
<br>

> [!TIP]
> An important one is `-e`, which switches the display renderer from `rgbmatrix` to `RGBMatrixEmulator`. This is useful in case you are not able to run the display output on physical hardware and is the fallback when actual hardware is not available.
> <br><b>Note: Running the emulator *is slow!*</b>, especially on single-board computers such as the Raspberry Pi.
> <br><b>Animations might be choppy or laggy</b> depending on your system and enabled settings. (expect about 12 FPS on a Raspberry Pi 3/Zero 2W)
> <br>
> <br>By default, `RGBMatrixEmulator` can be viewed through a web browser:
> - `http://<IP-address-of-device-running-FlightGazer>:8888`
> - `http://localhost:8888` (on the device running FlightGazer)


<details><summary>Advanced use</summary>

There's nothing stopping you from calling the python file directly. However `FlightGazer-init.sh` was designed to make running it smoother by handling the initial setup, making sure all the dependencies are there before running the actual python script, and automatically using the full paths for both the virtual python environment binaries and for the script itself, along with handling any arguments/flags that need to be passed.

You can run it like so:
```
sudo /etc/FlightGazer-pyvenv/bin/python3 /path/to/FlightGazer/FlightGazer.py
```
The main python file accepts almost all the same arguments as the initialization script, but you can always pass `-h` to see all possible operating modes.
</details>

### üîï Shutting Down & Restarting
To shutdown FlightGazer, do any one of the following:
<details><summary>Show/Hide</summary>

```bash
# preferred method
sudo systemctl stop flightgazer
```
```bash
sudo tmux attach -d -t FlightGazer
# then, press 'Ctrl+C' to stop
```
```bash
# if you started FlightGazer interactively and manually
Ctrl+C
```
</details>

To restart, simply do the following:
<details><summary>Show/Hide</summary>

```bash
sudo systemctl restart flightgazer &
# or, if it's currently not running:
sudo systemctl start flightgazer &
```
or, you may [start it manually](#Ô∏è-interactive-mode).
</details>

### üëì Misc

<details><summary>What the initialization script does</summary>

- Checks if there is an internet connection
- Checks if `first_run_complete` exists
  - Checks last modified date: if greater than 3 months, runs updates for installed dependencies
  - If file exists and is new-ish, then this isn't an initial installation and we just run the main python script
- Updates package list
- Installs:
  - python3-dev
  - libjpeg-dev
  - python3-numpy
  - python3-venv
  - tmux
- Create a new systemd service `flightgazer.service` if not present
  - Also creates a systemd service for the boot splash screen `flightgazer-bootsplash.service` as well, only if
    the `rgbmatrix` library is present 
- Write out `RGBMatrixEmulator` config file
- Makes virtual python environment at `etc/FlightGazer-pyvenv`
- Updates `pip` as necessary and installs the following python packages in the virtual environment:
  - requests
  - pydispatcher
  - schedule
  - psutil (usually provided in Raspberry Pi OS)
  - suntime
  - ruamel.yaml
  - orjson
  - RGBMatrixEmulator<br>
  *if the web app is installed as well:*
  - Flask
  - gunicorn
- Downloads the `tar1090-db` aircraft database and generates a sqlite3 database that can be used by FlightGazer
- Writes `first_run_complete` blank file to `etc/FlightGazer-pyvenv` to show initial setup is done
- Runs main python script with desired flags

</details>

<details><summary>Running on Windows</summary>

No fancy initialization script here. Run FlightGazer as so:
```
\path\to\new-python-venv\Scripts\python \path\to\FlightGazer\FlightGazer.py -i -e
```
or, if you didn't set up the virtual environment:
```
python \path\to\FlightGazer\FlightGazer.py -i -e
```
Pass `-h` to see all operating modes.

</details>

<details><summary>Useful commands</summary>

Terminating FlightGazer-related processes manually (Linux):
```bash
# Just the main FlightGazer process
kill -15 $(ps aux | grep '[F]lightGazer\.py' | awk '{print $2}')
# The web interface (using systemctl is recommended over this)
kill -15 $(ps aux | grep 'FG-webapp.py' | awk '{print $2}')
```
Changing `systemd` startup command
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/flightgazer.service
systemctl daemon-reload
```
Disabling startup at boot
```bash
sudo systemctl disable flightgazer.service
```
Deploy the full FlightGazer package in one go:
```bash
sudo bash /path/to/FlightGazer/FlightGazer-init.sh -c \
&& echo y | sudo bash /path/to/FlightGazer/install-FlightGazer-webapp.sh \
&& sudo systemctl start flightgazer
# :D

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è How to Update

It is recommended to use the most up-to-date versions!

Version v.2.x and newer:
```bash
# recommended
sudo bash /path/to/FlightGazer/update.sh
```
or, to use the most up-to-date version of the update script:
```bash
# alternative approach
cd /path/to/FlightGazer 
wget -O update.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WeegeeNumbuh1/FlightGazer/refs/heads/main/update.sh
sudo bash update.sh
```
<details><summary>Windows</summary>

You can run `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/WeegeeNumbuh1/FlightGazer \a\different\directory` and manually migrate your config.
</details>

<details><summary>Upgrading from v.1.x to v.2.x and newer</summary>

Use the alternative approach above.<br>
The migrator cannot migrate v.1.x configuration files to the newer format so you must manually migrate your settings.

## üöÆ Uninstall
```
sudo bash /path/to/FlightGazer/uninstall.sh
```
<details><summary>Windows</summary>

Simply delete the folder (and the virtual python environment if you set that up as well).

## ‚ùî Frequently Asked Questions (not really but they could pop up)
<details><summary><b>FAQ's (Open these before raising an issue)</b></summary>

**Q:** My RGB display is blank when running this, what broke?<br>
**A:** Check the `HAT_PWM_ENABLED` value in `config.yaml` and make sure it matches your hardware setup.<br>
Additionally, this project assumes the use of the adafruit rgbmatrix bonnet and only 1 HUB75-based RGB panel. Other setups are not supported.<br>
Getting the RGB display to work is beyond the scope of this project if it wasn't working before using FlightGazer.

**Q:** I broke it ü•∫<br>
**A:** Try running the updater first. If it's still broken, uninstall then reinstall FlightGazer.

**Q:** I restarted/updated my system but it took longer for FlightGazer to start. What's going on?<br>
**A:** The initialization script that starts FlightGazer checks if there are any updates to the dependencies it uses.<br>
If it has been over three (3) months since it last checked, then the next time it restarts, it will run these checks. It usually takes a few minutes to do this, but if your internet connection is slow or the system is loaded with other processes, then it could take longer.

**Q:** Okay, but this update is taking a *really long* time. Then, it just stops after awhile. Is it broken?<br>
**A:** First, restart the whole system. Then, let FlightGazer do the update again (it should do this automatically at system startup). If it stops again, try starting FlightGazer one more time. It should succeed at this point.<br>

**Q:** I see a dot on the right of the aircraft readout display. What is it?<br>
**A:** That is an indicator of how many aircraft are within your defined area. The number of dots lit up indicate how many are present. There will always be at least one lit up, all the way to 6. If the number is greater than 1, FlightGazer will start switching between aircraft to show you what else is flying in your area.

**Q:** Can I customize the colors?<br>
**A:** [Click here](#adjusting-colors)

**Q:** Can I customize the layout beyond what can be done in `config.yaml` (clock, aircraft info, etc)?<br>
**A:** Sure, just change some things in the script. Have fun. (also, you can just fork this project)<br>
(note: any changes done to the main script will be overwritten if you update with the updater) ![:gladsuna:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/824790344431435817.webp?size=20)

**Q:** Why use the FlightAware API? Why not something more "free" like [adsbdb](https://www.adsbdb.com/) or [adsb.lol](https://api.adsb.lol/docs)?<br>
**A:** In my experience, adsbdb/adsb.lol cannot handle chartered/position-only flights (i.e. general aviation, military, etc) and are lacking (correct) information for some flights. Because these open APIs rely on crowdsourcing and are maintained by a small group of people, the data offered by these APIs is prone to being outdated or incorrect. After testing, these APIs just aren't rigorous enough to be used for this project. It's better to have no information than misinformation. Plus, FlightGazer is still useful without having journey info anyway. I do wish FlightAware had a much lighter API endpoint for pulling very basic information like what this project uses.

**Q:** FlightGazer detected a plane and it couldn't determine a journey. This same plane showed up again a few minutes later and the result didn't change. What happened?<br>
**A:** If this plane is blocked from public tracking, there will never be a result. If you know it isn't, try lowering the value for `FLYBY_STALENESS`.<br>
This situation has been seen when a plane just takes off and the API FlightGazer uses hasn't begun tracking the plane just yet, therefore there isn't a result that the API can give. When this plane shows up again, FlightGazer will reuse the same API result since it would not count this as a new flyby, a metric controlled by `FLYBY_STALENESS`.<br>

**Q:** Why use a different font for the Callsign? I don't like how it looks different by default next to other readouts.<br>
**A:** If it's too bothersome, set `ALTERNATIVE_FONT` to `true` in the config file to make it more uniform.<br>
Reasoning: The original/default font is perfect with numerical readouts that update frequently (eg: speed, RSSI, altitude, seconds, etc) as the general glyph shape doesn't change between updates.<br>
The alternative font is perfect for the callsign because callsigns are alphanumeric, the readout changes less often, and the alternative font offers quick differentation between between homoglyphs ('0' vs 'O', '5' vs 'S') compared to the default font. 
Additionally, with fields that aren't alphanumeric (country code) or use a limited set of the alphabet (direction + distance), there's less of a need for the alternative font's advantages.<br>

**Q:** Some of your code is not pythonic!!!1!!111 ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/359007558532595713.webp?size=20)<br>
**A:** but it works, does it not? ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/389287695903621121.webp?size=20)<br>
(it should be >98% pythonic at this point)

## üêõ Known Issues, Shortcomings, and Reporting Issues

<details><summary><b>Show/Hide</b></summary>

- Flyby stats are not 100% accurate (but can be close, depending on your `FLYBY_STALENESS` setting in your config)
  - This stat relies on the number of *unique aircraft seen*, not each occurrence of an actual flyby
    - This is somewhat by design, covering the case of living near a general aviation airport and having the same plane do numerous touch-and-go landings
  - ~~For example, if plane with hex ID `abcdef` passes by at 06:00, then passes by again at 18:00, it won't count as a flyby~~ <br>**This has been fixed in v.1.3.0 with the addition of a new parameter, `FLYBY_STALENESS`**
  
- If using `No Filter` mode and restarting FlightGazer often, we can artifically inflate the flyby count
  - FlightGazer has a feature where it will write out stats before shutting down so that it can reload those stats upon restart (if it's the same day). The flyby count is simply a number and has no additional information such as the IDs of aircraft
  - Upon reload, FlightGazer fills in dummy IDs equal to the value of the last written flyby count in its internal list of aircraft IDs it keeps track of for flybys
  - The flyby count runs under the assumption that the flyby area itself is small, but since `No Filter` removes that restriction, it's a free-for-all
  - This is not usually a problem, as long as we don't restart often in the same day
  - May not ever get fixed
  
- On rare occasions are times when there will be two entries of the same aircraft (only when using `No Filter` mode)
  - This is an edge case that's been noted since the v.0.x days, mainly due to a dual receiver setup
  - It has been associated with aircraft that uses a dual mode transponder or there is TIS-B contact of the same aircraft on UAT while it's present over ADS-B
  - ~~So far there is no fix planned for this as this does not break core functionality~~
    - At worst it confuses the aircraft selector algorithm but even then it still selects normally
    - ~~May be mitigated in the far future~~
  - **This has been mitigated in v.2.6.3 and newer, fully fixed in v.5.0.0; FlightGazer will use the best entry it encounters when not using `No Filter` mode**

- ~~If FlightGazer crashes when run in tmux via systemctl, it will always report an exit status of 0~~
  - Complicated to fix due to all the signal handling between the main script, the initialization script, and systemd
  - ~~May not actually get fixed (simply just code better, smh)~~
  - **I think it's okay now**

## ‚úÖ Acknowledgements
Huge shout out to [RGBMatrixEmulator](https://github.com/ty-porter/RGBMatrixEmulator). This tool was invaluable for getting the layout dialed in and figuring out the logic needed to update the display correctly, all while avoiding having to program directly on the Raspberry Pi itself (VSCode Remote on a Zero 2W is literally impossible, I've tried).
